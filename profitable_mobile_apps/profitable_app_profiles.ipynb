    "### Purpose of this Project\n",
    "This project is designed to demonstrate my progress and competency with Python and Jupyter functionalities to produce a professional data analysis report. \n",
    "The style of this document follows the principles of **literate programming**, a coding paradigm first adopted in 1984 by Donald Knuth where code is accompanied by natural human language for enhanced code annotation and discussion of outputs. This style of workflow is highly advantageous in the context of data analysis as code can be easily annotated and clarified in markdown cells and results can be directly discussed in the same document. It also offers a huge advantage when combined with data visualization, as figures and graphs can be directly integrated into the same document (though this project does not focus on this aspect of the data analysis process).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background\n",
    "I am acting as a data analyst working for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. The company only builds apps that are *free* to download/install and for English-speaking audiences. Therefore, the company business model relies on in-app ads as the main source of revenue. Consequently, revenue for any given app the company builds is primarily controlled by the number of users of the app (and the amount of engagement users make with ads within the app).\n",
    "\n",
    ">The main goal of this project is to gain an insight into what kinds of apps are most likely to attract the largest user base so that our developers can make more informed decisions on the directions they could take when building new applications.\n",
