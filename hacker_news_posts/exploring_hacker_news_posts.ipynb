    "\n",
    "Analysis of posts from the Hacker News (HN) Forum was conducted on a sample of 20,000 posts scraped from the site during Sep. 2015 - Sep. 2016. Posts were separated into three distinct categories (`Ask HN`, `Show HN` and `Other`) and the data was explored to identify the impact of post submission hour on the comment volume. For a complete picture of the analysis process and conclusions, refer to the full analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The main findings are outlined below:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Posts falling into the `Ask HN` category generally accrued a greater average number of comments per post (**cpp**). `Ask` posts accrued an average of 14.04 cpp, compared to `Show` posts, receiving 10.32 cpp. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It was also noted that `Ask HN` posts with the greatest comment volume were typically posted between 3pm - 4pm EST, acquring an average of 38.59 cpp. This is a 60% increase compared to the second greatest posting hour of 2am - 3am EST (with an average of 23.81 cpp). \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Show` posts typically received a smaller comment volume than `Ask` posts. `Show` posts showing the largest comment volume (15.77 cpp) were posted between 6pm - 7pm EST.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although `Other` posts received a smaller comment volume than some of the top performing posts in the `Ask` category, it was noted that `Other` posts often received a large number of comments regardless of the time of day the post was published."

    ">### Purpose of this Project\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The following portfolio project is designed to apply the skills listed below into a real-world context:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">* Manipulating strings for data analysis\n",
    ">* Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    ">* Handling dates and times in the data anlysis process\n",
    ">* Functional programming (specifically, passing existing functions as arguments to other functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News (HN) is a website started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com), where users submit posts, receiving votes and comments (similar to how [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) operates). HN is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, with posts making it to the top of the listings often receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors and impressions as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users are able to submit posts to the HN community. Two of the common categories of post include:\n",
    "* `Ask HN` - where users ask the HN community a question or introduce a topic of discussion \n",
    "* `Show HN` - where users show the HN community a product, project or an interesting piece of media they have found\n",
    "\n",
    ">The goal of this data analysis process is to compare the above types of post to determine the following:\n",
    ">* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    ">* Do posts created at a certain time of day receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), a scrape of a year's worth of HN posts from September 2015 - September 2016. The raw dataset contains over 300,000 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this portfolio project, the original dataset has been downsampled to contain 20,000 records by removing all posts from the original dataset that received no comments and taking a random-sample of the remaining records. \n",
